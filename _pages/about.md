I am a fourth-year PhD student in the mathematics department at UC Berkeley, advised by Nicolai Reshetikhin.
I am intersted in quantum and low-dimensional topology and related topics in representation theory and mathematical physics.

## Research
Most recently I been thinking about invariants of links with extra structure, for example a flat Lie algebra connection on the complement or a representation of the knot group.
These are conjectured to have something to do with geometric knot invariants like hyperbolic volume.

Before that, I and [Kyle Miller](math.berkeley.edu/~kmill) wrote a paper on extending some quantum-topology techniques for planar graphs to graphs embedded in higher-genus surfaces.
In particular, we found a state-sum invariant of embedded graphs called the "S-polynomial."

## esselltwo
The [special linear Lie algebra of rank two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_linear_Lie_algebra) is a central object in representation theory.
"esselltwo" is one way to pronounce it.
