title: "Planar diagrams for local invariants of graphs in surfaces"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'In order to apply quantum topology methods to non-planar graphs, we define a planar diagram category that describes the local topology of embeddings of graphs into surfaces. We also discuss an extension of the flow polynomial called the S-polynomial and relate it to the Yamada and Penrose polynomials.'
